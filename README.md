- Video Motion Retargeting transfer motion from source video to target video. 
- It require 3 components. skeleton extraction, motion retargeting on skeleton and skeleton to video rendering.
- Copy_of_OpenPose.ipynb gives skeleton output in json format stating keypoints of human pose.
- 2d_motion_retargeting.ipynb[1] takes source and target json files as input to give retargeted skeleton.
